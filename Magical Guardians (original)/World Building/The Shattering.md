# The Shattering

Experimentation on new ways to harness [[Aethyr]] contributed to the [[Old Continent]] being fractured and spread into the current geography.  The [[Emotional Portals]] split apart, creating the [[Inner Isles]] and the larger [[Outer Archipelago]]. The [[Elemental Portals]] are now floating high above, creating odd weather patterns and random [[Elemental Storms]]. The [[Primal Portals]] took the brunt of the force and created their own landmass far away from everything.  The [[Primal Continent]] is protected by a living storm, named [[Squall]].
