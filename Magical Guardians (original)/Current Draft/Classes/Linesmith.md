### Advancements

#### Season One:

> You can choose to Over-Strain when casting a spell. If a spell would cause you to Over-Strain, you can double its effect.

> [!INFO]+ *Create Coincidence* 
> Add "Create Coincidence" to Assist Pool
> > [!TIP]+ *Create Coincidence* (1)
> > You subtly alter the Ley Lines around you to create a happenstance that works in your favor. You can count a 3 or 4 as a Success, this ability can be used multiple times for a single roll.
<br>
#### Season Two:

<br>
#### Season Three:
> [!INFO]+ *Increased Manipulation* 
> You develop a more efficient way of manipulating the Ley Lines; increase your MP to 15.

> [!INFO]+ *See the Past* 
> You can spend Strain to gain a clear vision of an important Event that has happened in the area. The amount of Strain depends on what information you want to glean, the more distant in the past or uneventful the event is the higher the cost. 

> [!INFO] *Ill Omen*
> Once per Session, you can gain 2 Strain to twist happenstance and cause someone to see something they believe will bring them bad luck. Until the remainder of the Scene, add 2 dice to all rolls made to overcome an Obstacle.   
<br><br>
#### Season Four:
> [!INFO]+ *Obvious Trail* 
> You can gain 2 Strain to create a glowing path made of Ley Lines. This leads you and your allies to your intended target.  Add 4 Successes to your next Tracking or Navigation roll to find your target. 

> [!INFO]+ *See the future* 
> You have learned to glean the future from the pattern of the Ley Lines around you. Once per Session you can spend Strain directly to add Successes to the Advantage Pool, this does not count as your turn.

> [!INFO]+ *Familiar Path* 
> You gain the ability to travel through the Ley Lines to a place you have visited before. Spend 1 Strain per being you want to teleport.
<br>
#### Season Five:
> [!INFO]+ *Great Creation* 
> You have gained mastery over the Ley Lines. You can create a large inanimate object directly from the Ley Lines themselves. With enough time and Strain, you can even make the object permanent.
