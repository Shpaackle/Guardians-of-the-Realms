<h1><center>Tangle</h1></center>
There are times when the comingling of energy to form [[Aethyr]] becomes corrupted or when the [Ley Lines](<Ley Line>) don't quite fit properly. This creates a Tangle and the energy begins to overflow causing the surrounding area to transform. Wildlife become twisted and dangerous, developing strange new abilities or growths. Plants and trees become sentient and carnivorous or emit a toxic cloud or sleep pollen or some kind of acid. Could also be fractures in the ground, drastic change of environment, dangerous magical storms, etc.
