### Consequence
> [!WARNING]+  *All consuming*
You have put too much Strain on your connection to your Portal, you now feel completely disconnected to the world around you. The call to cross through is loud and unavoidable, it is a beacon in the darkness around you. Everywhere you look are signs and portents, showing you the importance of your Portal to the world around you. Until you remove this Strain, your attention is consumed by the presence of your Portal in the world and inside your mind; you can only perceive/understand/retain the existence of your Portal and the things it is connected to in the world.
