### Consequence
> [!WARNING]+  *I think I messed up*
You have put too much Strain on your Manifestation, causing the two of you two lose your distinct forms.  You absorb your Manifestation into yourself, causing your form to change drastically and in uncontrollable ways.  Until you remove the Strain, your form is not your own and the ability to sense and communicate with the world around you is drastically hindered by this.
> You have called upon the power of your Oath so deeply that you are consumed with how you cannnot live up to what it requires. Convinced that you have done something wrong, you are wracked by self doubt and insecurities. You go out of your way to seek atonement for your misdeeds and will ask forgiveness for faults or slights, both real and imagined. Until you lessen the Strain in your Assist Pool, you cannot be assuaged of your guilt.
