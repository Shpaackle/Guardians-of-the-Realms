### Assist Pool - Alchemical Mysteries
**Spell Pieces:** *Latent, Essence*

**Volatile Mixture** (1) - Add 2 dice to a Destroy roll.
**Refine Essence** (2) - With the correct amount of time and items, you can distill the Aethyr from an object to temporarily gain a spell piece.  Fill in blank line with spell piece, removing when used as Personal spell pieces.  
**Secret Recipe** (1) - You quickly throw some ingredients together to create your secret 'cure-all' and toss it back. Roll Alchemy, add Successes to Advantage Pool and clear a condition.

**Consequence:  Unwanted Side Effects**
You've imbibed too many different ingredients and concoctions and now must suffer the side effects. This could be uncontrollable bodily functions, seeing or hearing things, feeling super intoxicated, numbing of body, etc. Until this runs its course or someone discovers a remedy, enjoy the ride!
<br>
### Specialty
*A Piece of Yourself* - You imbibe a special blend of ingredients to force a piece of yourself into the world around you.  Spend 2 HP to use a Personal spell piece as a Terrain spell piece.

### Advancements
**Season One:**
*Placebo Effect* - You throw together some harmless ingredients to heal an ally, roll Alchemy and heal for the number of successes, treating 4s as successes. (maybe 2s as edges instead)

*Something extra* - You have a secret ingredient that lets you keep going when your Strain is at 10. You are unable to do anything more complicated than move around and give barely understandable verbal responses.

*Steady Hands* - When you roll Daring/Alchemy, the GM cannot offer "you are injured" as the condition of an Edge Success.
<br>
**Season Two:**
*This should be safe* - You've created a version of your secret-recipe that is 'safe' for others to drink, can be used by others but treat 2s as edge successes

*Over-Strain* - You can choose to Over-Strain when casting a spell. If a spell would cause you to Over-Strain, you can double its effect.
<br>
**Season Three:**
*Improved Assist Pool* - Increase Assist Pool

*Toughened by Alchemy* - Once per Session, can take 2 Strain to remain standing until end of scene even if at or below 0 HP. 

*Elixir* - You create an alchemical concoction to do something specific. You can choose a Spell Piece for it and a specific Roll it can aid with; the user can Strain from its Assist Pool to cast a Spell with its Piece or add Successes to a roll. Can only be used once per Arc.
<br>
**Season Four:**
*Breakthrough* - Increase HP or MP

*Enhanced Senses* - You have honed your senses through training; you can count 4s as successes when rolling Sensitivity
<br>
**Season Five**
*Pure Aethyr* - You have discovered a way to purify and store Aethyr; roll Alchemy, this item removes Strain equal to the number of Successes. Can only be used once per Session.

<br>
<br>
(Brew Elixir - Roll Alchemy, number of successes added to future Roll or key word; maybe use Assist Pool like Mechanist's Gadgets)
(Assist Pool increase)
(HP or MP increase, player choice - alchemical breakthrough?)
(Alter Substance - Add to Assist Pool, Change small amount of one substance into another)
(Talk to plants, natural objects)
(Enhanced senses - count 4s as successes when rolling Sensitivity)
(Ability to distill a spell piece from the environment to carry around)
(You have discovered a way to store Aethyr, roll Alchemy, this item restores that much Aethyr to someone's Well when used.)

<br>

### Notes
(Change elixir to this might sting or some such)

(Pick me up -> only works on self, but advancement allows to work on others)

(Specialty -> add 2 extra dice to Alchemy roll when adding to Advantage Pool - *I've got just the thing!*)
