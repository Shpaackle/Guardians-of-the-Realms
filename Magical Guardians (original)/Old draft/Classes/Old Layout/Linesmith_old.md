### Advancements
**Season One:**
*Dangerous Path* - You can see the more dangerous paths the Ley Lines take.  You can treat 2s as Edge Successes, once per session. Can be decided after roll is seen

*Over-Strain* - You can choose to Over-Strain when casting a spell. If a spell would cause you to Over-Strain, you can double its effect.

*Create Coincidence* - Add the ability "Create Coincidence" to your Assist Pool
**Create Coincidence** (1) - You subtly alter the Ley Lines around you to create a happenstance that works in your favor. You can count a 3 or 4 as a Success, this ability can be used multiple times.
<br>
**Season Two:**
*Draw from the Line* - Gain 2 Strain to remove 1 Strain from your Assist Pool.

*Create Obstacle* - Add *Create Obstacle* to the Assist Pool
**Create Obstacle** (2) - You create an obstacle from the Ley Lines in the immediate area, closing off a path
<br>
**Season Three:**
*Increased Manipulation* - You develop a more efficient way of manipulating the Ley Lines; increase your MP to 15.

*See the Past* - You can spend Strain to gain a clear vision of an important Event that has happened in the area. The amount of Strain depends on what information you want to glean, 2 Strain for basic info, 4 Strain to get details. 

*Ill Omen* - Once per Session, you can gain 2 Strain to twist happenstance and cause someone to see something they believe will bring them bad luck.  Until the remainder of the Scene, add 2 dice to all rolls made to overcome an Obstacle.
<br>
**Season Four**:
*Obvious Trail* - You can gain 2 Strain to create a glowing path made of Ley Lines. This leads you and your allies to your intended target. Add 4 Successes to your next Tracking or Navigation roll to find your target.

*See the future* - You have learned to glean the future from the pattern of the Ley Lines around you.  Once per Session you can spend Strain directly to add Successes to the Advantage Pool, this does not count as your turn. 
<br>
**Season Five:**
*Great Creation* - You have gained mastery over the Ley Lines.  You can create a large inanimate object directly from the Ley Lines themselves. With enough time and Strain, you can even make the object permanent.

Need to rethink this class to be more about building/manipulating Ley Lines
Maybe use something like AR to show the Ley Lines
