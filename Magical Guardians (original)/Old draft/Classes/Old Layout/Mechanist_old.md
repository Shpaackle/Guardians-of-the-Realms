**Consequence: Spark of Inspiration**
The Strain on your connection causes your Golem to malfunction, but through this you have been granted a vision of a way to improve them or a new gadget to make to rely on them less. Until you are able to remove the Strain on your bond by beginning this project, you are unable to do anything else. 

You are granted a vision of some great new invention or upgrade and immediately begin to fixate on it. Until you are able to begin work on this project, you are unable to concentrate on anything else.
