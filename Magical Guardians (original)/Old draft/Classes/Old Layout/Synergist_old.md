### Assist Pool: Stronger Together <br>

**I Feel Your Pain** (2) - You lay a comforting hand on someone and offer a sympathetic word. Heal ally for 5 HP.

**My Friends Are Always With Me** (1) - You can use one of your ally's Spell Pieces as your own.

**Consequence: I Am Utterly Alone**
When your Assist Pool is full of Strain, you are completely disconnected form your friends and allies. Overwhelmed with a deep loneliness, you crumble emotionally and physically.

The closer you normally are to a person, the more difficult it is to remember who they are.
