### Assist Pool - ~~My Word is My Oath~~/Careful What You Promise
**Spell Pieces:** *Eternal, Bond*

**Let's Make a Deal** (1): When you make a deal with another person and infuse it with the power of your Bond; you will know if the deal has been broken.

**Word Play** (2): You can change the form of a Personal spell piece that anyone added to the Chord. 

**Punish the Unworthy** (1): You gain a clear of impression of something the target has done that would not live up to your ideal, you call upon the power of your Oath to punish them.  Add 3 Successes toward the Destroy goal.

**Consequence: ~~Everything in Order~~ I think I messed up**
~~You must get your records in order, maybe you've discovered insight into a new organization method or you just need to make sure. Overwhelmed by this situation, you immediately begin to arrange your notes and contracts. Until everything is in order to your satisfaction, you must focus on only this.~~

You have called upon the power of your Oath so deeply that you are consumed with how you cannot live up to what it requires. Convinced that you have done something wrong, you are wracked by self doubt and insecurities.  You go out of your way to seek atonement for your misdeeds and will ask forgiveness for faults or slights, both real and imagined.  Until you lessen the Strain in your Assist Pool, you cannot be assuaged of your guilt.

Assist Pool: Consequence - Looking for a Loophole
	You begin pouring over your current contracts and oaths, convinced you can find a loophole
	You must get your records in order. Overwhelmed by the need to make sure everything is ordered, you immediately start organizing your notes & contracts. Until everything is in order to your satisfaction, you must focus on only this. (Or maybe you discover a new way to look at your notes/research/contracts instead, but still to the same effect)
