**Share Senses** (1): You go into a light trance, sending your senses to your Manifestation.  You are able to see and hear through them.

### Consequence
#### *Who Am I?*
You have put too much Strain on your Manifestation, causing the two of you to lose your distinct forms.  You absorb your Manifestation into yourself, causing your form to change drastically and in uncontrollable ways.  Until you remove the Strain, your form is not your own and the ability to sense and communicate with the world around you is drastically hindered by this.
