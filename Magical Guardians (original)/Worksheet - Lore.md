<b>How does magic work in your game world?</b><br>
Spiritual energy, [[Aethyr]], suffuses the planet; traveling along Ley
Lines between the Portals. New branches can be created to bring a more
plentiful supply to a location, but these areas create points of
weakness in the Line and need to be maintained/monitored.
<br><br>
<b>What relationship do you want players to have to magic?</b><br>
Aethyr has become an industry all on its own. Not only is it in the
atmosphere and ground, but society has incorporated it as an energy
source. Not everyone is born with the [[Spark]] to become a Guardian,
but many people are born with a latent ability to manipulate the
energy around them. There is also a place for retired Guardians to go
for research or government, etc to put their powers to the betterment
of society.
<br><br>
<b>How does an everyday person in your world feel about magic?</b><br>
Aethyr is seen by many to be useful but also dangerous. Most people
interact with it in minimal ways or just as a backdrop to their lives,
not thinking about it until something terrible happens.

**How does your game lore express the value of Teamwork?**
Aethyr is inherently easy to combine, especially when done through
different means, i.e. [[Wielder]] + [[Conduit]]; since each of these
distills the energy in a different way. Aethyr wants to be whole,
wants to be more.
