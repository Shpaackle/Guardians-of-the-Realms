#Conduit - When acting in name of connection, cannot be X'd (ie no damage to Understanding or cannot be Scattered, or no Over Scatter)


**Words of Encouragement** - You tell one of your allies how awesome they are, they either recover from a condition or regain #Aethyr


*Mystic Maelstroms*â€¦that is all


*Boomshroom*


Replace Specialties in Class Workbooks with some kind of Portal connection?  Do I keep just emotional connections, or do I let the players decide things?  Maybe make that part of the Key and Signature Spells?
