## Horrors
### Shipwreck (2 turns per round)
Destroy: 4 (Banish, purify, or destroy Shipwreck)
Redirect: 8 (Lure Shipwreck elsewhere)
Outlast: 6 (Survive until dawn or escape)
Shipwreck manifests as a blue-black cloud like ink swirling through water. Buried in the absolute darkness of its body is something solid that can be felt or struck, but never seen. Every so often something deep inside its formless body flashes with a warm orange light.
Fog (2) – The Horror expands, spreading its inky cloud out around itself. No one can use Sensitivity rolls to see their surroundings.
Slam (3) – The Horror creeps close to a party member, slamming its solid core into them for 2 damage and knocking them over, preventing Daring rolls for the next turn.
Siren Song (2) – The Horror flashes that peculiar orange light from inside the cloud. Everyone who can see the light gains 2 Scatter.
Breaking Wave (1) – The Horror manifests something solid within its form and rushes over a person, knocking them over and preventing Daring rolls for the next turn.
Splinter (3) – The Horror crashes into a target, slamming the wreckage at its core into them for 3 damage.

### Broadside (3 turns per round)
Destroy: 4 (Destroy, purify, or banish Broadside)
Redirect: 10 (Persuade Broadside not to attack)
Outlast: 6 (Flee or survive until dawn)
A memory of the roar of cannons and splintering of ships in an era where even the sea was a battlefield, Broadside manifests as a winding serpent like a black ribbon floating in the air, about three feet wide and six feet long, made of stiff chitinous plates. It has six holes, each about the size of a grapefruit, running through its body, and within each glows a peculiar golden light. A trail of tattered fins like an ancient curtain runs along the bottom of its body, trailing along in the dust. Its face is empty and skeletal, with eyes like black pits and a bony jaw lined with small teeth.
Encircle (2) – Broadside winds its body slowly through the air, curving around a person.
Barrage (2 or 5) – Spheres of rusty orange iron form in the holes in Broadside’s body and, fueled by a deafening explosion, launch themselves at the party. If no one is currently encircled, everyone in the party takes 3 damage. If someone is encircled, the difficulty is increased to 5 and that person takes 6 damage.
Fire (2 or 4) – A single sphere is launched from the horror’s side at a party member. That person takes 2 damage. If that party member is encircled, the difficulty to avoid this attack is increased to 4.
Bloody Scream (4) – Broadside unhinges its bony jaw and lets out a shriek that sounds like roaring fire, breaking wood, and desperation that seems to immerse the world in chaos. No one in the party can roll Understanding for the rest of the day.
Splintering (3) – A flash lights inside Broadside’s body and the air is filled with wooden splinters, jagged and smeared with what looks like blood. For the next round, anyone trying to advance a Goal will take 2 damage.
Drown (4) – If Broadside is currently encircling someone, that person is bound in a pillar of debris-littered saltwater and cannot act until a Goal is advanced. If no one is encircled, a wall of water between Broadside and the party prevents them from advancing any Goals until the end of their next turn.


### Burning (4 turns per round)
Destroy: 5 (Destroy the Horror)
Redirect: 10 (Stop it from attacking anyone)
Outlast: 6 (Contain the flames, survive until daybreak)
A memory of a burning building and the ones trapped inside it, Burning lurks in the dockside district of Stageport, no doubt near where it was born over a century ago. It appears as a whirling mass of glowing red-orange light and pitch-black smoke that winds around in circles, sometimes twisting itself out into the shapes of desperate and grasping hands. The smell of burning wood follows it, and embers like falling stars trail in its wake.
Plume (4) – A gust of hot air blows through Burning, carrying with it a thick plume of black smoke. Anyone breathing the smoke takes 1 damage whenever they act and cannot roll Sensitivity.
Ignite (2) – A nearby object suddenly bursts into flame, which will continue to spread every round until Outlast is advanced. If it spreads three times, the building itself catches fire, and if it spreads four times, nearby buildings will also go up.
Grasp (2) – One of the smoky hands manifests from the chaos of Burning’s interior, reaching out for a party member. If it grabs them, they are trapped and cannot act until a Goal is advanced.
Flare (5) – A burst of searing hot air and fire explodes out of Burning. Everyone in the scene takes 4 damage. If anyone is grasped by Burning, that person takes 6 damage.
Debris Meteor (2) – A bundle of burning wood manifests in midair and falls directly on a party member. That person can not roll Daring until a party member spends their action to help instead of either contributing to the Advantage Pool or advancing a Goal. The trapped party member takes 1 damage every round until freed.
Spark Constellation (4) – The air is filled with pinpricks of burning light. Every party member takes 2 damage.
Intensify (2) – The flame inside Burning grows brighter, shifting to a white-gold color that sears the eyes. If it has successfully used its Plume ability, then the amount of damage dealt by the smoke goes up to 2 per action. If it has successfully used Ignite, the fire spreads twice. If it has successfully used Debris Meteor, the damage increases to 2 per round and the trapped person loses the ability to roll Daring entirely.

## Noble Demons
### The Princess of the Southern Isles (6 turns per round)
Destroy: 10 (Fight off her predations)
Redirect: 8 (Plead with the Princess to spare you.)
Outlast: 5 (Escape her domain with your life)
The undisputed ruler of a misty southern archipelago, the Princess of the Southern Isles hides among the rocks of her domain, waiting for human ships to come close enough to attack. She prizes nothing so much as the taste of raw human flesh and bone, and none who have tried to parlay with her have returned to tell the tale. She appears as a human silhouette in the mist, crowned by a writhing mess of muscular black tentacles she uses to lash out and grab her prey. A collection of lesser daemons prowl the rest of the archipelago, vying to be the one to bring her next meal to her waiting jaws.
Snatch (2) – The Princess reaches out with her tentacles to grab a party member. Until a Goal is advanced, that party member cannot act.
Lash (2) – The Princess strikes out with one of her tentacles, causing 3 damage to one person.
Summon Mist (4) – With a low hiss, the Princess summons a thick fog bank. No one can roll Sensitivity and the difficulty to Outlast is increased by 1.
Seafoam (3) – The Princess dives into the ocean and vanishes beneath the waves. Until her next action, no one can advance any Goal except Outlast. If she is currently holding someone, she will drag them beneath the sea with her.
Bite (2 or 4) – If the Princess is currently holding on to someone, the difficulty to avoid this attack is 4 – otherwise, it is 2. She sinks enormous jagged fangs into someone, causing 5 damage.
Command (4) – At the orders of the Princess, her Lesser Daemons emerge from the ocean to swarm the party and their vessel. Until 10 successes are spent, no one can advance Outlast.
Shattering Wave (3) – Thanks to the many retainers of the Princess, the ocean is whipped into a frenzy as an enormous wave bears down on the party. No one can roll Daring or Navigation this round.
Misty Fang (1) – The Princess vanishes into mist, emerging to nip at the party with transparent fangs like a shadow in the fog. One person loses the ability to roll Understanding and takes 2 damage.

### The Radiant Prince (4 turns per round)
Destroy: 8 (Fight the Radiant Prince and defeat him)
Redirect: 4 (Convince the Radiant Prince to let you leave)
Outlast: 6 (Escape from his shrine with or without his
consent)
The occupant of an abandoned shrine in the mountains of the Coral Coast named Escape Route of the South Wind, the Radiant Prince spends his days in luxury, lounging on the altar and accepting gifts brought to him by his strange little daemons. He is obsessed with treasure, particularly with getting gifts, which he keeps in a secret chamber in the back of the shrine. He will not accept immaterial gifts – people who come to offer their services or talents will find themselves shut in the chamber themselves. The Radiant Prince looks like a young man, slender and graceful, wearing a coat of sunset-colored feathers plucked from his daemons, with slightly glowing eyes of bright yellow. Quiet and matter-of-fact in his speech, he is not outright hostile to people, though he does not understand their needs or particularly care about them.
(Additional Rule: The Radiant Prince will not use his moves to deal damage to party members until Destroy or Outlast is advanced.)
Stone Empathy – (5) The Prince uses his control over the stones of the old shrine to move them, quickly and with great force. If Destroy or Outlast have been advanced, he uses this to deal 4 damage to a single party member.
Seal the Exit – (5) The Prince moves a slab of stone to cover the door, making escape impossible through normal means. Until Redirect is advanced by 1, the difficulty to Outlast is increased by 3.
Radiant Glare – (2) The Prince’s yellow eyes glow like the sun itself, flooding the chamber with horrible searing light. Everyone who can see the Prince can no longer roll Sensitivity to see their surroundings.
Twist Words – (2) The Prince accepts your deal – at least, he accepts what he has decided is the deal. The difficulty to Redirect is increased by 1 until it is successfully advanced.
Iron Will – (4) The Prince has made his decision and will not be swayed. Redirect cannot be advanced this round.
Chime of Authority – (4) The Prince’s courtiers make a peculiar chiming sound in unison and shake their feathers hypnotically. Everyone who can see or hear them gains 4 Scatter.
Relic Barrage – (5) The Prince telekinetically retrieves a dozen swords, spears, and other weapons from his treasury and sends them flying at the party. Everyone in the party takes 3 damage.

## Lesser Daemons
### Radiant Courtier (2 turns per round)
Destroy: 3 (Fight the Courtier and destroy it)
Redirect: 5 (Convince the Courtier not to attack you. It might even to do you a favor.)
Outlast: 3 (Run)
A peculiar creature about the size of a housecat, and attendant to the Radiant Prince. It has a marshmallowy looking little round body without any limbs; it hovers around two feet off the ground. Its eyes are enormous and dark, and though its toothy mouth cannot be seen at first glance, it can open wide enough to devour a creature its own size in one bite. By far its most striking feature is its tail, made of long, luxurious, sunset-colored feathers that trail on the ground behind it. As it moves, it makes a quiet chiming sound. These little daemons can often be seen cleaning the shrine where the Radiant Prince lives, or else wandering the jungle looking for presents to bring him.
Chime Charm (2) – Everyone who can see the Courtier swishing its soft feathers is entranced and gains 2 Scatter.
Bite (2) – The Courtier opens its toothy maw and clamps down hard, driving little needle-like teeth into its target. One person takes 3 damage.
Radiant Glare (3) – The Courtier shines with a light given to it by its creator. Everyone who can see the Courtier can no longer roll Sensitivity.
Inspect (1) – The Courtier approaches a party member, watching with its weird wide eyes. The difficulty to Outlast or Destroy is increased by 1 permanently, and the difficulty to Redirect is decreased by 1 permanently.

## Automata

### Buried Turret (2 turns per round)
Destroy: 5 (Destroy the Turret)
Redirect: -
Outlast: 5 (Escape)
On The Veldt, there is a great cresting wave of earth where the side of a gentle hill fell away in a long-ago landslide. As one approaches, one can see a faint glimmer from inside this wall of mud, a pinprick of reflected light. Someone very observant may even spot a faint movement in the hillside as the automaton seeks a target. While it is still too far away to make out, however, it attacks. A beam of white light collects in the mud and then focuses, sending a ray of fire toward the party.
The Buried Turret is not particularly large, only about the size of a child, and its movement is severely restricted by the hillside. It looks like a metal block, affixed with several dark and shining lenses, sitting above a set of decaying treads. It sets its sights on anyone approaching it and attacks, mindlessly, from far away.
(Additional Rules: Redirect cannot be advanced in this encounter. The turret’s turn starts immediately after the Advantage Pool is formed, before the party can act.)
Beam (4) – A beam of searing white light rips through the air at the party. One party member takes 2 damage.
Target (2) – The Buried Turret watches and waits. The next time the Buried Turret uses its Beam attack, the difficulty to avoid it is increased by 1.
Ignite (1) – The Buried Turret shoots at the lush grasses of the Veldt, lighting them ablaze. The party can spend 3 successes in order to put out the fire. After one round, the difficulty goes up to 4, and it continues to increase in difficulty every round it is allowed to burn. If the fire is left to burn for three rounds, the area is flooded with white smoke, increasing the difficulty to advance a Goal by 2 and decreasing the difficulty to avoid the Turret’s Beam attack by 2.
Mudslide (2) – The Buried Turret struggles to free itself from the ground, and in doing so, causes a cascade of ancient earth to slide down on the party. No one in the party can roll Daring until the end of the encounter.

## Nature and Disasters
### Shorecat (3 turns per round)
Destroy: 3 (Fight the Shorecat)
Redirect: 5 (Scare the Shorecat away or convince it to
pursue another target)
Outlast: 6 (Run)
A feline ambush predator, native to the Coral Coast, about the size of a large husky. Shorecats have a layer of dense gray plating, like that of an armadillo or pangolin, and stocky, muscular bodies. Their preferred meal is seabirds, which they pluck from the shores and the sky with sudden leaps, but in desperate times, they’ve been known to attack humans.
(Additional Rules: Whenever Destroy is advanced, Redirect is also advanced by one)
Circle (2) – The Shorecat bides its time, observing the party with cold eyes. Until the end of the party’s next turn, the difficulty to advance a Goal is increased by one.
Bear Down (4) – The Shorecat suddenly makes a huge leap forward onto a party member, bearing them to the ground. That party member is pinned and cannot act until a Goal is advanced.
Rake (4) – Bringing its powerful hind legs up, the Shorecat rakes its back claws against a trapped foe, dealing 3 damage. The Shorecat will only use this move if it has someone pinned.
Bite (2 or 5) – Stout, powerful jaws lined with sharp teeth close around a party member, dealing 3 damage. The difficulty to avoid this attack is 5 if it is being used against a pinned character.
Swipe (2) – The Shorecat swings its broad forepaw at a target, dealing 2 damage with its claws.

### Maritime Eagle (4 turns per round)
Destroy: 5 (Fight the Maritime Eagle)
Redirect: 4 (Lure the Maritime Eagle elsewhere)
Outlast: 6 (Hide from the Maritime Eagle and escape its predations)
A great golden-colored bird with a wingspan the width of a ship and feathers like swords. It lives on remote islands and rocky coasts, where it hunts by circling high, fixing its gaze on suitable prey, and diving. It ordinarily eats fish or medium-sized animals like goats, but if presented with humans, it will absolutely attempt to swoop on them and carry them off.
(Additional Rule: Whenever Destroy is advanced, Redirect is also advanced by one)
Observe (2) – The Eagle chooses a target and fixes its gaze on them, closely watching their movements. The difficulty for the target to avoid an attack from the Eagle is increased by one until the Eagle uses the Snatch, Rake, or Batter attacks below. The Eagle may use this multiple times in a round.
Soar (2) – The Eagle flaps its enormous wings and gains altitude. The difficulty to advance any Goal is increased by one until either the Eagle uses the Snatch, Rake, or Batter attacks below or Destroy is advanced. The Eagle may use this multiple times in a round.
Snatch (1) – The Eagle dives toward its prey, talons-first, in an attempt to grab them. The target takes 2 damage and is unable to take any actions until a Goal is advanced or until the Drop attack is used.
Drop (2) – If the Eagle is holding a target after using its Snatch ability above, the Eagle can then drop the target onto the rocky shore or unforgiving ocean. The target is freed and can act, but takes 5 damage.
Rake (2) – The Eagle attempts to gouge its target with its cruel talons. The target takes 3 damage.
Batter (2) – The Eagle uses its muscular wings to buffet a target, knocking them to the ground with powerful force. The target is unable to act next turn and loses the ability to roll Sensitivity.
