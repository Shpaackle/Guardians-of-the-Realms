# What is this game?


# How to Play


# Creating a Character
## Step One: Choose your Dimensional Plane

Each Magical Guardian is born with a connection to a Dimensional Plane. This is the thing which awakens the Spark in each person.  

Your connection to your Plane is deeply personal and no two Guardians will describe or personify it in the same way. 

Once you have selected your Dimensional Plane, also add its name to your list of Personal spell pieces.

## Step Two: Choose your Class

The way in which Magical Guardians wield their powers is as unique as their Spark but each can be broadly categorized by the method in which they do so.  Choose your class from the following list, each will offer a different way to express your magical connection.

- Conduit
	- The connection to your Dimensional Plane is so deep that you are able to channel Aethyr directly through your body.
- Extractor
	- Through your skill in Alchemy, you have learned how to distill Aethyr from the objects around you.
- Invoker
	- Your bond with nature through your Dimensional Plane allows you to control the Aethyr in the environment, creating a Manifestation (a being made purely of magical force).
- Linesmith
	- The ability to directly manipulate Ley Lines allows access to Aethyr; you are able to see and alter how they run. You can even construct something new or teleport through them.
- Mechanist
	- Understanding the way different pieces of machinery work together has created a connection to Aethyr. You have created a Clockwork Golem infused with a bit of your Spark.
- Oathbound
	- You have sworn an oath to something greater than yourself, allowing you access to Aethyr. This bond allows you the ability to twist words and hold people to theirs.
- Synergist
	- The belief in the strength of people working together and wanting to be that guiding force has allowed you access to Aethyr.  Your power comes from the connections you form with your friends and allies.
- Wielder
	- Some form of Implement has allowed you to channel the power of your Portal and gain a connection to Aethyr.  When you wield this item, you are transformed into a Magical Guardian and your Implement becomes a mighty Weapon in your hands.

## Step Three: Choose your Spell Pieces

Now that you have chosen your Class and Dimensional Plane, it is time to select the spell pieces from the list that each of these grants access to.

Choose 5 words from the list offered by your Class.

Choose 2 more words from the list offered by your Dimensional Plane

Also, you can add the name of your Dimensional Plane to your list of words.

## Step Four: Assign your Stats

Each Magical Guardian is assumed to be tough, smart, wise, agile, etc.  Our stats will be more about how your character goes about solving problems; are they more focused on being unnoticed, maybe they just rush right into action, or perhaps pondering on the solution to the situation? 

Your character starts with 1 point in each Facet, and you get to put another 5 points however you would like.

<br>

## Step Five: Select your Skills

Now that we have our Class and Facets, we can move onto our skills.  In Guardians of the Ley Lines, there are 21 skills, your character will start out being trained in roughly half of them.  Each of these skills can be used with any Facet, depending on how you are approaching the situation or what you want the outcome to be.
Mark down the 5 skills you automatically get from your Class and then choose 4 more from among the following list:
- Aethyr
	- 
- Art
	- 
- Athletics
	- 
- Engineering
	-
