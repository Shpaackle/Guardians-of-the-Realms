**What is the concept of your world?**
<br>

**What will you call the Magic resource?**
[[Aethyr]]

**What happens when Magic is all spent? How is it regained?**
Players have connection with the world around them. They seem to fade, emotions are numbed. It's as if the essence of life itself had been drained from everywhere.

Each #Guardian has learned their own way to reconnect with the Aethyr but regardless of the means it takes time and attention. For some it is a good night's rest, for others hours spent in training or meditation. Whatever it may be, it cannot be accomplished rushed or without intention.
