# Dimensional Vessel

You tap directly into the energy from your Realm, forming a deep bond. This bond is what gives you strength and allows you to manipulate Aethyr. The power of your Realm is limitless but if you draw from it too deeply its energy can overwhelm you.

## Bond Pieces
- Boundless
- Strength

## Bond Abilities

> [!ability] *Dimensional Surge* (2)
> Calling upon the power of your Realm, you channel Aethyr into your next action. Add 4 dice to your next roll. 

> [!ability] *True Purpose* (1)
> You fall into a meditative state, reaffirming your connection with your Realm. Remove 2 Magical Strain.

> [!ability] *Spiritual Anchor* (1)
> You emit an aura surrounding you and your allies that solidifies your resolve. Add 3 Successes towards the Outlast goal.

## Consequence
> [!WARNING]+  *All consuming*
> Calling upon the power of your Realm has put too much Strain on your connection and you now feel completely disconnected from the world around you. Everywhere around you are signs and portents from your Realm reminding you that you don't belong here. Until you remove this Strain, your attention is consumed by the pull of your Realm calling you home; you can only perceive and understand the things surrounding you that are connected to your Realm.
> ~~You have put too much Strain on your connection to your Portal, you now feel completely disconnected to the world around you. The call to cross through is loud and unavoidable, it is a beacon in the darkness around you. Everywhere you look are signs and portents, showing you the importance of your Portal to the world around you. Until you remove this Strain, your attention is consumed by the presence of your Portal in the world and inside your mind; you can only perceive/understand/retain the existence of your Portal and the things it is connected to in the world.~~
