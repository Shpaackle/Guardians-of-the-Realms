%%~~My Word is My Oath~~%%
You gained access to Aethyr by swearing an Oath to either a cause or being related to your Realm. This allows you to infuse your magic into any promise made to you and also gives you insight into how powerful words can be. If you call upon this too strongly, you will be reminded of all your failings and will feel compelled to make amends.
