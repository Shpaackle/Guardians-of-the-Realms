## Bond Pool 
<h2><i><center>Magical Implement</i></h2></center>
You wield an Implement, a magical item that allows you to transform into a Magical Guardian and gain your powers. Through training and grit, you have learned to channel Aethyr to keep your teammates safe. When you draw upon this power, it weakens your Implement until it no longer has anything to give. You will be forced to transform back to normal until it has time to recharge.

### Bond Pieces
- Deft
- Maneuver

### Bond Abilities
>[!IMPORTANT]+ *Empowered Strike* (2)
> You channel the full power of your Realm through your Implement, creating a magical strike. You add 4 additional Successes to your attack roll.

>[!IMPORTANT]+ *I've Got Your Back* (2) 
> You can defend an ally from an attack without spending from the Advantage Pool.

 >[!IMPORTANT]+ *Pyrrhic Advantage* (X)

<br>
### Consequence
> [!WARNING]+  *I think I broke it*
> You have placed too much Strain on yourself and your Implement and it now needs to recharge. You lose the ability to manipulate Aethyr in the environment and your connection to your magical powers through your Realm. You also revert back to your normal persona. Until you have given your Implement time to recover from the Strain, you cannot transform into your magical self.
> ~~You have put too much Strain on your Implement and it now needs to recharge. You lose your connection to Aethyr and transform back into your non-magical self. Until you have given your Implement time to recover from the Strain, you cannot transform into your magical self. ~~
