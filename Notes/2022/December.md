# 12-7
- Change Assist Pool to Bond Pool. Change Strain pools to just Aethyr and Stamina/Physical
- Description for each category of Realm/Portal. Elemental - more physical/attack oriented, Emotional - support oriented, Primal - powerful but not combat oriented
- Think about trimming down # of Realms

# 12-8
- Give [[Mechanist]] ability to summon tools or create tools from Aethyr, maybe [[Linesmith]] instead to fit theme
- Add magic tattoos?

# 12/11 
- Instead of choosing 1 Realm, maybe you can select words from multiples. Either you rank the Categories and select a number from each. Or you get a number of points to spend, 1 point per word, except some Categories cost more?

# 12/15
- Add *shape* or *shaping* to Spell Pieces for [[Linesmith]]

# 12/25
- Add "Battle Trance" to [[Wielder]]
- Add "Berserker" to either [[Wielder]] or maybe as [[Combat Advantage]]. Also think about adding it as an ability to Realms if we go down that route.
