# Quest Notes
## Abilities
### Vow
You create a vow that permanently binds you in service of an ideal. You may only do this once. There is no turning back.
You can express this bond as devotion to a deity, a people, a cause, or something else that represents or is served by your ideal. (You may use an ideal you chose when creating a character, or choose a new one.) You must be in a safe and quiet place to make the vow, and it must include:
* Something you promise to actively do in service of your ideal, like helping the sick.
* A person, place, or group you promise to protect when nearby.
* A wrong from your past that you pledge to make amends for someday.
Once the vow is created, you receive these ongoing benefits:
* You can now use your Invoke ability once per game session for no AP cost.
* The healing effect of your Petition ability now affects nearby party members in addition to you.
* Your eyes now have a faint glow.
You have a sacred obligation to fulfill the promises you have made. Each time you betray the promises of your vow in a serious way, you feel a sharp pain in your heart, and your maximum HP decreases by 1. You cannot be reduced below 5 maximum HP from this effect.

### Evil Eye
#### Cost: 1
You pause, closing your eyes and quieting your mind. You sense the worst thing that ever happened nearby. The Guide will describe to you the type of thing that happened and what the people involved look like.
For example, you might learn that someone was murdered, a curse was created, or an evil vow was taken.

### Soul Gaze
***roll the die***
#### Cost: 1 
Your eyes turn black, like shimmering gateways to eternity, as you peer into the eyes of a nearby creature. They become momentarily transfixed on your gaze.
**20**: You learn the creature's ideal and flaw. You also learn the worst and best thing they have ever done.
**11-19**: You learn their ideal and flaw. 6-10: You learn their ideal and flaw, but
one is false.
**1-5**: They resist your invasion and briefly glimpse your recent thoughts.

### Impression
#### Cost: 1
You brush against a creature for a fleeting moment, feeling its desires. The Guide chooses and reveals to you something specific that the creature routinely craves. You become cursed to also crave that thing and cannot use Impression again until you fulfill the desire. When you fulfill it once, the curse is lifted.

### Sigil
You draw a magic sigil on an object. The spell lasts until you cancel it or cast Sigil again. You can only cast the spell if no enemies are currently nearby. 

Choose a specific creature for the sigil to affect, or a type of creature, like spirits or werewolves. Then draw a circle on a piece of paper at the table. Draw the creature that will be affected by the spell inside of the circle. Choose one of four effects:
* Lure: The sigil attracts creatures to its location, where they linger for a minute. 
* Repel: Creatures who come nearby won’t move closer to the sigil or may turn back. 
* Alert: Receive a signal in your mind when creatures pass by the sigil. 
* Message: The sigil telepathically sends a short message of up to 10 words in your language to creatures passing nearby.

You may keep your drawing and reuse it later when casting this spell again and you can choose a new effect each time. 

### Remedy
#### Cost: 1 
You scavenge your area for a short time to find a plant-based remedy for an ailment. You find enough
for a single dose. The remedy cures temporary illness and eliminates poison.

### Shroud
You entreat nearby flora to provide the party with protection while camping in wilderness. (There must be plants nearby.) Shrubs and thorny vines will emerge around the campsite to provide concealment. The shroud lasts until you leave the camp.

The shroud conceals the light from a small campfire. If hostile creatures advance on the party’s campsite, the trees will rustle and howl to provide 5 minutes of early warning. Creatures can pass through the shroud, but they are hit for 1 HP if they push through. When you regroup (p. 14) inside of
the Shroud, your party gains the benefit of a rest.

### Read the winds
#### Cost: 0 
You concentrate on the language of wind, sensing weather patterns in your region of the world. You are able to glimpse a weather forecast for the next few days in your region of the world.
#### Cost: 2
If you spend 2 AP on this ability, you may choose the weather that you foresee in your region over the next few days, as long as it is seasonally appropriate. You might choose light rain, a thunderstorm, fog, a heat wave, or any other weather pattern, except for natural disasters like tornadoes or hurricanes.

### Navigate
#### Cost: 0 
You feel the land in your bones. You cannot get lost in wilderness unless magic is inhibiting you.
#### Cost: 1 
You navigate your party to one of the following areas when traveling in wilderness:
* oasis. You find a reprieve that has a small amount of nourishment.
* shelter. You find a natural cave that offers shelter from harsh weather.
* ruins. You find minor ruins, like an abandoned keep or a withered statue.
* nest. You find the home of an animal or group of animals, like an otter's den.

### Track
#### Cost: 0 
When you find tracks, you can instantly identify the type of creature that left them. If it is an animal,
the Guide will share a fact that you know about them, like their habits or personality traits.
#### Cost: 1 
You can pick up on the trail of an animal of your choice even if there are no tracks nearby, as long as it is native to the environment you're currently in. You must choose a type of animal to find, like a boar or a squirrel. (You can't use this to find a specific creature.) You find the creature after a short search.

### Speak with animal
#### Cost: 1 
You touch an animal that is not currently hostile toward you, forming
a telepathic bond with it for the next minute. You are capable of interpreting the animal's thoughts and feelings,
and you can have an exchange of communication with it. It can give basic information about things, like how it feels, what it has seen, and what it wants, but it does not understand complex ideas.

### Courier
#### Cost: 1 
You find a friendly animal nearby and whisper to it, giving it instructions to deliver an item. The item must be small and light enough for the animal to reasonably carry. You can have the animal deliver the item to a place or a specific person. The destination must be within a day's travel time.

### animal form
#### Cost: 2 
You take the form of a wild animal, adopting its shape, senses, and range of motion. You may choose any creature that is no smaller than
a mouse and no larger than a horse. Everything you carry becomes part of your animal form.
While in animal form, you have 6 HP. You may make basic attacks that hit for 2 HP. You can't cast spells, use items, or speak languages while transformed.
You can return to your normal form at any time. When transforming back, you regain the hit points you had before you transformed. Falling to 0 hit points while transformed instantly returns you to your normal form.

### shapeshift
#### Cost: 3 
This is a master version of your Animal Form spell (p. 58). The rules are the same, except for these differences:
* You can choose a creature no smaller than a housefly and no larger than an elephant.
* You have 10 HP in animal form.
* Your animal form attacks hit for 3 HP.
* You can send messages telepathically to members of the party.

### thorn
***roll the die***
#### Cost: 0 
You open your palm, conjuring a poisonous thorn that you shoot in a straight line toward a nearby target creature or object. The thorn hits for 2 HP.
**20**: The thorn's poison is amplified. If you hit an organic creature, its skin becomes swollen, it cannot see beyond its reach, and it can't speak or cast spells until the end of its next turn.

### freeze
#### Cost: 0 
You blow cool air, creating freezing winds that swirl around a nearby creature or object. Affected creatures feel a deep chill in their bones and are hit for 1 HP. You can use the spell to snuff out small fires.
#### Cost: 2 
You freeze a nearby commoner, minion, or object, encasing it in ice until you leave the scene. If you freeze a creature, it cannot move or act. The ice shatters, and the creature is freed if it takes any additional damage.

### burn
#### Cost: 0 
You blow hot air, creating scorching winds that swirl around a nearby creature or object. The heat
is enough to make the creatures very uncomfortable but not enough to harm them.
#### Cost: 1 
You overcharge the spell and ignite the target in flame instead, hitting it for 2 damage and setting it ablaze.

### wild aspect
#### Cost: 1 - eagle 
You gain eagle-eye vision
for the next minute. You can see anything in your line of sight clearly, even if it is far away, and you can detect faraway movement that would be imperceptible to a normal person.
#### Cost: 2 - cat
You purr softly under your breath, imbuing up to 6 nearby creatures with the spirit of the cat.
For the next hour, affected creatures gain the ability to see things nearby
in complete darkness as if they were
in a dimly lit room. The effect cannot pierce magical darkness. Affected creatures may occasionally feel the urge to stop what they are doing and clean themselves.
#### Cost: 2 - wolf
You howl, imbuing up to 6 nearby creatures with haste. (Howl at the table.) For the next hour, creatures affected by the spell can outrun any other creatures while traveling by foot.

### prey sense
#### Cost: 1 
You sharpen your sense of danger for the next hour. You feel a subtle signal in your body whenever you will imminently be threatened by another creature. (The hair on your skin might raise, or you might feel a tingling in your bones.) This includes creatures that you can't see.
If you detect a creature this way, your party cannot be ambushed. (If you detect a creature trying to attack you, your party gets the first round in combat.)

### command nature
#### Cost: 0
You whisper a rhyming couplet to the living plants around you. You can write your own or borrow one from another author. Use one that plants might appreciate, like "Hear my voice ring, and welcome the spring."
Your brief poem entreats the plants to produce a harmless effect by moving or growing slightly. The things you want to manipulate must be within range. You may make trees rustle, cause leaves to fall, get plants to bloom, vines to expand, and seeds to sprout.
#### Cost: 1 
If you can explain how, you can have the effect deal 2 HP of damage to a nearby target. For example, you might have vines grow thorns and lash a creature, or have a tree shake its acorns on their head violently.

### memories of stone
#### Cost: 3
If you encounter a stone monument, like a mountain, canyon,
or statue, you may touch it to channel its ancient wisdom. You must tell
the stone a story about your family — perhaps a memory of a gathering, like a holiday. Give this story at the table.
The monument reciprocates your offering by sharing its wisdom.
* You sense whether this world is real and natural, or some kind of machination.
* You sense whether there are any long-lost monuments beneath the surface, like hidden temples or ancient vaults.
* You vaguely sense the most powerful lost artifact in this world and the region where it might be located.

### mend
#### Cost: 1 
You gently touch a creature, immediately restoring 5 HP and mending minor wounds like cuts and bruises. The spell does not remove impairments, heal permanent wounds, or cure disease. You cannot use this spell during combat.
relieve
#### Cost: 1 
You say something comforting to a nearby creature, alleviating them of anxiety, pain, and discomfort for one hour. In this state, the creature cannot be affected by fear or confusion. For
a brief time, they feel better than they have ever felt before.

### deathsense
#### Cost: 0 
You naturally sense whether any remnants of the dead (spirit creatures) are nearby, but not their positions. The Guide will notify you when this sense is triggered.
#### Cost: 1 
You sense whether any sentient creatures have died nearby and how long ago they died. You can sense the location where any creatures died,
as well as the general nature of their death; you sense if they were killed by natural causes, an accident, or foul play.
#### Cost: 1 
You extend your vision, allowing you to see spirit creatures who are invisible. This effect lasts until you leave the area.
commune with the dead
#### Cost: 1 
If you are aware of one or more spectral creatures nearby (like ghosts), you may communicate with them. You do not need to be able to see a spirit as long as you have sensed its presence, like with the Deathsense spell.
You may have a conversation with
the spirits for up to a minute, and you communicate with them telepathically. You must share a language to understand each other. Spirits must want to respond; if they choose not to speak to you, your adventure point is refunded.

### corrupt
#### Cost: 0 
You grip an organic creature within reach and create a necrotizing wound. The wound turns flesh black- green and branches out from where you touched them. The spell hits for
1 HP immediately, and again at the beginning of the target's next turn. (A total of 2 damage.) Affected creatures can only recover these hit points with the Restore spell (p. 67).

### nox
#### Cost: 1 
You touch a creature, giving them a combination of effects for the next hour. You may choose up to three effects from this list:
Wakefulness, alertness, increased confidence, euphoria, laughter, vivid sensations, relaxedness, sweating, nausea, chills, or irritability.

### afflict
***roll the die***
#### Cost: 3 
You touch a creature, cursing them with an affliction that lasts up to 1 month. Choose a symptom each time you use this ability:
the sillies. The creature acts completely out-of-character in a silly and carefree way. This may change their goals.
clumsy. The creature's extremities feel awkward to use. They are unable to wield weapons effectively and they drop things constantly.
blighted. The creature can't recover HP.
If you roll a failure, the affliction becomes contagious, rapidly spreading to any creature that touches your target. On a catastrophe, you also become afflicted.

### wither
#### Cost: 4 
You touch a creature and cause their body to wither. Their lifespan does not change, but they experience some of the effects of advanced age. They begin to feel as if death is approaching on the horizon — a condition that may change the creature's behavior and goals.

### poison
You combine basic goods from any well-stocked general store to create poison. You create enough poison for one use. You can apply it to weapons, put it in drinks or meals, or serve it to a creature directly. Regardless of delivery method, each use of the poison can only affect one creature. Choose any combination of effects:

#### Cost: 1 blue. 
The victim falls asleep for 1 hour.
#### Cost: 2 white. 
The victim writhes in extreme pain for 1 hour and is unable to speak.
#### Cost: 3 purple. 
The victim collapses and is paralyzed for the next day.
#### Cost: 4 black. 
Commoners and minions are instantly killed. Bosses are hit for 10 HP.
#### Cost: 6 clear. 
The victim experiences no symptoms and dies 1 week later. (This does not work on bosses.)

### tracker
***magic item.*** 
A pair of devices that allows
you to track something.
The kit includes a magical tag the size of a tiny bead that is sticky and can be applied to most surfaces. The tracker is linked to a magic compass that shows the direction the tag is in.
The arrow on the compass is black. It turns gold when the tag is in your scene, and begins to vibrate softly.

### dossier
***magic item.*** 
A magic book that copies
things. You can make a Dossier of any size — from a pocket-sized folio to a coffee table book.
#### Cost: 0 
You can use the book to copy
any kind of writing or drawing that is pressed against its pages. For instance, if you press a handwritten letter against one of the Dossier’s pages, a legible but imperfect copy will appear inside

### persona
You carefully prepare a convincing alternate identity. You cannot create a persona of an existing person or the identity of someone who holds an exclusive position, like the ruler of an existing nation.
Each persona consists of a wardrobe, credentials, and a backstory. You may create and describe each element of the persona.
When you use your alternate identity, you must outwardly present yourself as that person by wearing their costume.
#### Cost: 2 
You create the persona of a common person of average means, like a farmer, artisan, traveling salesperson, priest, soldier, or teacher.
When using a commoner's identity, you can effortlessly blend into crowds and travel unnoticed in public spaces.
#### Cost: 4
You create the persona of an officer (someone in a position of formal authority), like a politician, judge, military officer, guild leader, or ship captain.
When using an officer's identity, you may:
* Enter restricted areas that your rank and affiliation gives you access to.
* Give mundane orders to people you outrank, like running errands or keeping watch.
#### Cost: 6 
You create the persona of an aristocrat, like a prominent socialite, wealthy business owner, ambassador, or governor.
When using an aristocrat's identity, you may:
* Enter exclusive spaces for the rich and famous, like private clubs or balls.
* Seek audience with local rulers.
* Spend 1 AP for a get out of jail free card that pardons you for minor crimes.

### overthere
#### Cost: 1 
You make a suggestive gesture, redirecting a nearby creature that is currently hostile toward you. The target redirects its anger toward a different adversary. (The spell does not work
if the target has no other enemies nearby.) This effect is canceled if you harm the creature.

### splitting image
#### Cost: 1 
You vanish momentarily, reappearing with two illusory duplicates at your side. Your duplicates travel alongside you and perfectly mimic all of your movements.
If a creature attempts to target you, the Guide must flip a coin. If it turns up "heads," you are targeted; on "tails" one of your duplicates is targeted. If one of your duplicates takes damage, it disappears.

### phantom menace
#### Cost: 2 
You read the mind of a nearby NPC and produce an illusion of a creature they find extremely irritating. Only you and the target of the spell can see and hear the illusion.
For the next 10 minutes, the illusion relentlessly mocks and taunts your target, provoking their full attention.
You may control the illusion directly and have it manipulate small objects. For example, you can have it steal an item from the target and lead them on a chase. Or you may let the illusion go
wild, allowing the Guide to narrate its behavior.

### bamboozle
#### Cost: 1 
You make a nearby creature mildly confused about a specific subject until you leave the area. For example, you could make a merchant confused about the value of their goods, a guard confused about who is authorized to pass, or a dog confused about whether he is a good boy.The confusion is lifted if you push the deception too far, like trying to trade a rock for a priceless item.

### fear
***roll the die***
#### Cost: 4 
You breach the mind of a nearby creature to seek their worst fear.
**20:** You learn the creature's worst fear. They become permanently haunted by it in every waking moment. Over time, their personality is destroyed, and they become unresponsive to others.
**11-19:** You learn the creature's worst fear. You may then conjure the image of this fear in their mind's eye, paralyzing them with dread for the next 10 minutes. They cannot act, except to flee danger.
**6-10:** You learn the creature's worst fear, but they reject you from their mind before you can conjure the fear.
**2-5:** You learn the creature's worst fear, but it paralyzes you with dread for the next 10 minutes. During this time, you are unable to use abilities.
**1:** When confronting the creature's fear, you become permanently haunted by it. You must choose an additional character flaw. You can only lift the fear by having the Liberate spell (p. 45) cast on you.

### loosen
#### Cost: 2 
You twirl your finger as if you are unwinding a spool of yarn. Starting with a single creature nearby that you can see, you create a cascading wave of magic mischief that loosens anything fastened or tightened around nearby creatures. For example:
* Bags become unclasped and spill out their contents.
* Shoelaces become untied, belts unbuckled, and shirts unbuttoned.
* Pets become unleashed.

### magic strike
***roll the die***
#### Cost: 0 
You must be holding a pointed object like a wand, staff, or sword to use this spell. You use it to shoot a shimmering missile of force in a straight line at a target you can see, dealing 2 damage.
#### Cost: 2 
You overload the missile, increasing its damage to 4 and hitting the target automatically. You do not need to roll the die if you overload the spell.
kindle
#### Cost: 0 
You rub your hands together, causing a flammable object you can see nearby to ignite in flame. The spell can ignite textiles, wood, paper, and other combustible material.
This spell cannot be used directly on creatures, but it can be used to ignite flammable things they are wearing or carrying. Igniting something on a creature deals 1 damage to them.

### familiar
#### Cost: 2 
You summon a tiny spectral creature, like a bird, a lizard, a butterfly, or anything else of a comparable size. The familiar is the avatar of a random spirit creature from your world. It becomes your ally and will follow your instructions. The Guide chooses the creature's background and personality, and speaks for them. The familiar
may choose to leave you if they are mistreated.
The familiar cannot move out of your sight. It can pick up and move objects no larger than a coin purse and no heavier than 10 pounds. It can't attack.
Your familiar has 4 HP. It is invulnerable to non-magical harm. If it is reduced to 0 HP, it vanishes, and your bond is broken. You may only have one familiar at a time.

### blink
#### Cost: 1 
You teleport to a location of your choice nearby. You vanish, leaving behind a gentle gust of wind and then instantaneously reappear nearby.

### gate
#### Cost: 1 bind. 
You bind yourself to the room you are currently in. It must belong to you or a member of the party. This is your Circle. You may only bind yourself to one at a time.
#### Cost: 3 gate. 
Snap your fingers. Any willing party members nearby are instantly teleported to your Circle.

### portal
#### Cost: 3 
You conjure a portal of any shape and orientation that is no larger than a door. It appears at a location of your choice nearby. The portal looks like
a window to whatever is on the other side, and its edges crackle and spark with energy. When you cast the spell again, the new portal automatically connects to the previous one. The portals remain open until you choose to close them. Anyone that can fit may pass through them.
dark door
#### Cost: 2 
You knock on a door, making
it a temporary portal to a specific shadow plane. You must be aware of the shadow plane's existence to create a door to it. (For example, if you see
a creature with a Cosmic Purse, you can open a door to the purse's shadow plane.) When you open the door, you can see inside the plane, and you and your allies may enter it. If the door is closed, the portal vanishes. (If the door closes behind you, you become trapped in the shadow plane and must escape with other means, like with Gate.)

### teleport
***roll the die***
Snap your fingers.
#### Cost: 5 
You and any willing creatures nearby vanish instantly, leaving behind a small shockwave of air in your wake, and are teleported to any place you choose.
**20:** Everyone arrives safely. You recover the spell's full AP cost.
**11-19:** You all arrive safely. Good for you.
**6-10:** You all arrive. Choose one: you take 7 damage from turbulence, or a magic item you are carrying is destroyed.
**2-5:** The party arrives safely, but nobody else does. You don't know where they went. You lose an item you are carrying.
**1:** The spell fails. Party members are lacerated by an arcane explosion
and are each hit for 5 HP. All other travelers are torn apart in a gruesome spectacle. (They die.)

### no
***roll the die***
#### Cost: 2 
By uttering the word "no," you attempt to neutralize a spell that you see an NPC casting nearby. You must declare you are using this ability before the Guide describes the consequences of the spell.
**20:** The spell is violently canceled and its caster is hit for 1 HP.
**11-19:** The spell is stopped before it's cast.
**6-10:** The spell misses and hits another nearby creature or target.
**2-5:** The spell takes effect normally.
**1:** You accidentally amplify the spell. If it is a harmful spell, the damage is doubled.

### reflect
***roll the die***
You produce a counterspell, reflecting a spell that targets you. You must declare that you are reflecting the spell as soon as the Guide says that you are being targeted by a spell.
**11-20:** The caster is hit by their own spell, instead of you.
**6-10:** The spell reflects off of you but misses its caster.
**1-5:** The spell reflects off of you but hits a nearby party member instead.

### enscroll
#### Cost: 2 
You create a Spell Scroll (p. 145) that can be used to produce a spell that you know. You must add the AP cost of the spell you are inscribing to the cost of Enscroll. For example, if you create
a magic scroll that can produce your Teleport spell, you must spend 7 AP.
You must spend a short time in a safe and quiet place to prepare the scroll. You decide what is written on it. The user of the scroll must read the words aloud to activate the spell it contains.

### spellsteal
#### Cost: 3
After you observe a creature nearby casting a spell, you may briefly enter their mind to glimpse its nature. You learn the spell and can produce it once.
Your theft gives you the minimum know-how to produce the spell, but you have not mastered it. The Guide may not fully reveal the effects or potential consequences of some stolen spells.
Once you cast or Enscroll the stolen spell, you forget the spell and cannot use it again.

### sense magic
#### Cost: 0
You get a gentle tingling feeling
in your bones whenever you are near a powerful source of magic. You're aware that magic is in the area, but not its location or nature.
#### Cost: 1 
You discern the location of nearby magic and its general nature. For instance, the Guide may reveal that you sense a magic sword, a cursed door, or an illusion.
#### Cost: 2 
You study the precise nature of nearby magic, learning its specific effects. If you use this ability to study a mysterious magic item, its name and effects are revealed.

### scry
#### Cost: 1
Once per game session, you may flash forward in time to glimpse your actions in the near future. For the next hour, you can avert failure by redoing a roll of the die. You must take the result of the new roll.
Or you may ask the Guide to reveal a situation you are likely to encounter based on the current trajectory of your choices. You may ask the Guide questions about what you sense from this glimpse of the future, but the answers may be vague, as if you are trying to find detail in a watercolor painting.

### stretch
#### Cost: 2 
Choose a nearby creature or object that is no smaller than an ant and no larger than a horse. You cause it to instantly enlarge or shrink. It can grow up to twice its size or shrink up to half of its size. The target's weight increases or decreases proportionally, but its
hit points do not change. You cannot enlarge something beyond the confines of the space it's in.
#### Cost: 4 
You may stretch an object no smaller than an ant and no larger than an elephant.

### undo
You speak a word of power, reversing the fate of a nearby object. The spell cannot be used to affect living things.
The thing you are undoing must be the discrete result of another creature's effort. For example, you might undo
a creature's shoelaces, unthread a garment, cause a piece of furniture
to fall apart, or revert a sculpture to a block of marble.
Choose how much effort to undo each time you use this spell:
#### Cost: 1 
Up to 1 minute of effort.
#### Cost: 2 
Up to 1 day of effort.
#### Cost: 3 
Up to 1 week of effort.
#### Cost: 4
Any amount of effort.
