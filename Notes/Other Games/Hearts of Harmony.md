    -   Pure Honesty
        
        -   When your honesty flows from you, you can ask a subject a question from the list below. They will feel compelled to answer you truthfully, and then they may ask you a question from the list as well, which you must also answer truthfully.
            
            -   What are you really feeling right now?
                
            -   What are you trying to hide?
                
            -   What do you want from me?
                
            -   How could I get you to ________?
                
            -   Whom do you serve?
                
    -   Trust Fall
        
        -   When falling, you can perfectly control the speed of the fall. You can extend this effect to any nearby subjects, but you may have to Thwart Peril if you want to try to keep them safe from things.
            
    -   Prepared to Defend
        
        -   People around you can trust in you to protect them and help them out no matter what dangers you may be facing. When you Help Out with a Clash and would suffer stress because of it, or when you try to Protect Someone, you will suffer 1-stress less.

Villains

Magical heroes will face off against all manner of dangerous foes. They can be complex masterminds or brutal monsters. Think how each episode of a show where a strange opponent shows up to ruin the day. These episodes can then be woven into an ongoing arc, revealing an even greater villain that has been pulling the strings all along.

To help guide you through how a villain may achieve their goals and behave, it will need the following details to take shape:

-   A description
    
-   A villain type and motivation
    
-   Mystical powers
    
-   Attacks and armor
    
-   How much stress will bring it down
    
-   Any weaknesses it has
    
-   A goal
    
-   Custom moves for powers (optional)
    

First up is the description. This can be as detailed or loose as you want. What is important is that you have a clear idea of how to describe it to the players.

Next is the type of the villain. There are around twelve types of villains represented in the media and the below list of types are meant to guide you on how to portray their behavior and how they may achieve their goals.

-   Beast
    
    -   to go wild, destroying and bring harm
        
-   Breeder
    
    -   to give birth to, bring forth, or create evil
        
-   Collector
    
    -   To gather or steal specific things
        
-   Destroyer
    
    -   To bring about the end of the world/worlds
        
-   Devourer
    
    -   To consume and grow
        
-   Executioner
    
    -   to punish the guilty
        
-   Parasite
    
    -   To infest, control and spread
        
-   Queen
    
    -   To possess and control
        
-   Sorcerer
    
    -   To usurp unnatural power
        
-   Tempter
    
    -   To tempt people into evil deeds
        
-   Torturer
    
    -   To hurt and terrify
        
-   Trickster
    
    -   To create chaos and uncertainties
        

This is not in any way meant to be a limiter on what the villain can do, its motives, or how it will act. The type is meant to serve as a reminder of what to do when you are in doubt about what actions the villain would take or how it would react to the meddling of the heroes.

A good villain doesn’t just go down when it has been hit a bunch. It needs a sort of defense or power that makes it hard to deal with. Powers that allow it to easily evade the heroes or make it hard to bring it down. At least one such power is advised, but it can have more depending on how dangerous it is.

-   Something that makes it hard to capture
    
-   A powerful defense that nullifies some, most, or all attacks.
    
-   Something that keeps it going despite its injuries.
    

Consider the villain’s theme and nature when coming up with a defense. But also remain flexible during the game. If the players come up with a great solution, you should reward them for thinking outside the box. Not to mention, sometimes the players might misinterpret something you have said, and it is usually more entertaining to just roll with it and play to see what happens.

The next step is determining the villain’s goal. The idea is to not define the goal too much. This will make it easier for you to make changes as the game progresses and improvise when needed.

If you don’t already have an idea fo the goal, you can seek inspiration in its type. This will generally give an idea of how and what it will be working toward and give a good feel of HOW it will go about it, even though it might not be too detailed.

If you are still coming up with a blank, you may get some inspiration when setting up the premise with the players. Otherwise, you can during the Premise Setup, simply ask the players a loaded question to get a feel for what they think could be an interesting scheme to thwart: dastardly kidnappings, evil mind control, rampaging menace, infectious evil.

Minions

Some villains will have minions to do their bidding. They can be weaker versions of the villain, allies, or the villain’s servants. But ultimately, their actions will somehow further the villain’s dastardly plan.

Minions need the following details:

-   A description
    
-   Minion type and motivation
    
-   Supernatural powers, if any
    
-   Attacks and armor
    
-   How much stress will take it down
    
-   A weakness (optional)
    
-   Custom moves for powers (optional)
    

There are ten minion types:

-   Assassin
    
    -   To hunt down the heroes
        
-   Brute
    
    -   To intimidate and attack
        
-   Cultist
    
    -   To sacrifice themselves for The Cause
        
-   Guardian
    
    -   To bar a way or protect something
        
-   Right hand
    
    -   To back up the villain
        
-   Plague
    
    -   To swarm and destroy
        
-   Renfield
    
    -   To push victims towards the villain
        
-   Scout
    
    -   To stalk, watch, and report
        
-   Thief
    
    -   To steal and deliver to the villain
        
-   Traitor
    
    -   To betray people
        

Most minions will have some sort of supernatural power, but it is not a must. Some minions can be everyday folk with no special powers. You can roughly follow the same guidelines as for the mystical villain when creating their powers.

Bystanders

Bystanders are the mundane folk in the world. They can be victims, friends, witnesses, nosy school teachers, and anything in between. You should include at least one victim for the heroes to save and push them to action.

Each bystander needs the following details:

-   A name
    
-   A description
    
-   A bystander type and motivation
    

There are nine types of bystander:

-   Busybody
    
    -   To interfere in other people’s plans
        
-   Detective
    
    -   To rule out explanations
        
-   Gossip
    
    -   To pass on rumors
        
-   Helper
    
    -   To join the heroes
        
-   Innocent
    
    -   To do the right thing
        
-   Official
    
    -   To be suspicious
        
-   Skeptic
    
    -   To deny supernatural explanations
        
-   Victim
    
    -   To put themselves in danger
        
-   Witness
    
    -   To reveal information
        

Consider what the bystander’s role could be within the story. Why they are here, why they could be part of the villain’s plan, and what drives them.

Locations

Locations are places that will most likely cause problems for the magical heroes or offer some opportunities to explore the world and story. They will contain the kinds of things you might see going wrong in many tv-shows. A phone not working, lights going out, confusing layout, etc.

Locations need the following:

-   A name
    
-   A description
    
-   Location type and a motivation
    
-   Optionally, a map
    
-   Optionally, one or more custom moves
    

There are ten location types:

-   Crossroads
    
    -   To bring people, and things, together
        
-   Death trap
    
    -   To harm intruders
        
-   Den
    
    -   To harbor monsters
        
-   Fortress
    
    -   To deny entry
        
-   Hell gate
    
    -   To create evil
        
-   Hub
    
    -   To reveal information
        
-   Lab
    
    -   To create weirdness
        
-   Maze
    
    -   To confuse and separate
        
-   Prison
    
    -   To constrain and prevent exit
        
-   Wilds
    
    -   To contain hidden things
        

Start by just defining a location that you expect will play a significant part in the story that will take place. Then maybe expand to lesser areas that might be relevant. But like a lot of the other prep; do this loosely to allow for easier change. You might get some inspiration and ideas from the players or might need to make changes if the players seem to want to go in a different direction.

Good locations to start with are:

-   The general area
    
-   The villain’s hideout
    
-   Places where the villain has been active, or attacked someone
    
-   If there are minions, places they are working on their evil plan
    
-   Places that a bystander will be
    

Event Countdown

Each story has a countdown: a list of event sequences that will happen if the heroes don’t stop the villain. The countdown is there to help guide you on what could happen off-screen.

To create the countdown,, think about what would happen if the heroes never came to help.

-   Who would be attacked?
    
-   Who would die?
    
-   What is the monster’s ultimate plan/goal?
    

Once you have an idea, divide it into six events in the order they will occur. Then allocate them to the steps in the countdown. The steps are:

-   Day
    
-   Shadow
    
-   Sunset
    
-   Dusk
    
-   Nightfall
    
-   Midnight
    

The names of each step are intended to give a sense of things getting worse. They are metaphorical: the “sunset” step of a countdown doesn’t have to happen at sunset; the steps don’t have to happen on the same day.

To begin with, though, it is a good idea to only write down the countdown for Day, Shadow, and maybe Sunset. This gives you some directions to go in the beginning, but later on, makes it easier to incorporate what the characters do rather than try to force the game to specific ending.
