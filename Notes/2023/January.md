- [[Oathbound]] - Change to Oathbinder??  Their power comes through Oaths they have received. I think now it's through an Oath. Maybe we can keep that?
- What if I added an Isekai element to the game?? Each player was Summoned or Pulled or Killed or something along those lines. Then they are reborn, forged anew, etc. to create their new bodies with magic built in. This is how they form connection with certain realms, allows the use of the magic inherent to the world. Can spend experience to gain new connections, like Disciplines from Vampire? Each class gains access to one category and the player gets to choose another? Or two could be assigned by Class but that forces Classes into certain molds that I've struggled to avoid.
- Maybe each of the Categories gives an ability or choice of abilities at each level up. Or each Category offers Abilities to be purchased.
- What if I treated character creation like a video game, or maybe through some kind of quiz? Take some inspiration from skill selection walkthrough in Vampire.
- If we go the Isekai route then there could be "How Our Tame Came Together" section. The reason behind the Summoning/Calling; the Organization/Group who did it; what they are Fighting/Protecting against; Loss they have suffered;
- Rethink [Mechanist Bond Pool](Guardians/Mechanist#Assist%20Pool), instead of Golem flavor it as Gadgets to help them do something. Similar in feel to [[Extractor]]. Maybe give Golem as an option, or add-on ability to the Pool. [See other notes](Notes/2022/November#11-6)

# 1-5
- Add ability to [[Linesmith]] to find something useful in the Scene. Maybe as an upgrade for create coincidence? Think about making coincidence a standard ability in the bond pool.

# 1-6
- Take inspiration from The Brain playbook for background stuff maybe?

# 1-14
- Thinking again about different totals for MP/HP/BP for each class
- Maybe each class gets access to a certain number of Realms? Like the [[Conduit]] gets more and [[Extractor]] or [[Wielder]] would be less. This would give each a different feel. Maybe [[Conduit]] as first level ability gets access to more words/portals?
- Was also thinking about maybe creating spells from a certain number of realms and then your class pieces. That way there would be creativity but "set skills" and you could maybe spend XP or something to gain more? Maybe you set the level when you create it, like it costs that number of MP to use, minimum and gives that many Successes as spent MP.
- If [[Wielder]] has more BP than other classes, it shows that their power more comes from their bond than actual magic. For the [[Conduit]] maybe more MP to show their strength in the ability to manipulate [Aethyr](Skills/Aethyr).

# 1-15
- Make [Alchemy](Skills/Aethyr#Alchemy), [Realms](Skills/Aethyr#Realms), [Implement](Skills/Aethyr#Implement), [Ley Lines](Skills/Aethyr#Ley%20Lines) a specialty of [Aethyr](Skills/Aethyr). That way only the specific class gets access to it and gives flavor to their class, it comes by choosing the class.
- [[Invoker]] chooses form of [Manifestation](Guardians/Manifestation#Assist%20Pool) at character creation, give examples in class description.
- Add *"Traumatic Memory"* (change name) as an ability to an Emotional Realm or as an attack for an Encounter
- [[Wielder]] - rethink [Implement](Guardians/Wielder#Assist%20Pool) as only a weapon? Maybe it could be a wand or book or some such? If we choose that route the abilities in the Bond Pool need to change as well as the abilities for leveling up. Split between the two types of Wielder, combat oriented and support/utility oriented.
	- I like this idea, focus on utility vs attack, that way a player can focus on whatever they want. Implement takes a form of the player's choosing, i.e. ring, amulet weapon, book, etc. Uses this in their transformation. They can use magic outside of that?? Like this but don't have access to the Bond Pool unless transformed, especially the words.
- [Synergist](Guardians/Synergist) - bonds between people, group dynamics, etc. Figure out what their specialty skill will be, maybe Synergy?? Could use that with Aethyr and used as group action or using the strength of their bond.
- Rethink turning this into a PbtA-like game?? Must as an Approach (new name for Facets??) with Specialty/Skill to overcome an obstacle? Would need to rethink how Bond Pools work. Still want the backlash when they use it too much. Could still probably use it in the same way and maybe basic moves remove points from it?
- Bond Pools - Add note about as use of it increases that they should start roleplaying it more.
- [Oathbound Bond Pool](Guardians/Oathbond#Assist%20Pool) name - **"My Word is Binding"**

# 1-19
Give [[Wielder]] ability to combine a spell and weapon attack together. Maybe as part of the Bond Pool. Maybe replace the one that just adds Successes.

## Quest Notes
### Abilities
- Counterattack
	- make roll after being attacked? Or maybe 1 time per combat when an enemy misses with an attack or it's saved against. Probably belongs with the Wielder maybe as a Bond Pool ability??
- Intercept
	- Get in way of attack so that it is aimed at you.
- Make a Plan
	- With time to prepare before an encounter, you get free first round or maybe extra dice to roll for the initial Advantage Pool
