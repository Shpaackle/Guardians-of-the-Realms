- Conduit abilities should deal with portals or Dimensional stuff, since that's the source of their powers.
- Was having thoughts of focusing on the Emotional ~~Portals~~ Realms and adding the elements into it.
- Wat if Emotional Realms were teh "major" sources of power and Elemental/Primal were "minor" You pick a primary Realm as your source of power and the others are just for flavor.
- What if Invoker got ability to pull on minor Realms more? Like in their ability pool or an advancement that allows them to get more flavor words
