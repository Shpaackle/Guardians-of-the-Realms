- Use something like "Affinities" from *Fight, Item, Run* or "Team Moves" from *MASKS*. Reveal a deep secret, confide in ally, workshop this.
	- [[Synergist]] needs to play on this hard
	- maybe this can add 1 Success to a roll or clear a Condition
- Change Level/Season to something like Rank/Tier
- Change/Split [[Linesmith]] to Forger/Artificer/Crafter, Aethyr Forge/Smith, Fate Spinner, Fate Weaver
- [[Conduit]] Ability - Once per Scene/Combat/Session a nearby ally can use one of your Spell Pieces instrad of the Local ones. You can still add one of yours to make it a Chord
- Conduit is kinda like Warlock/Cleric, you Channel the power of something bigger greater. This gives the GM something to work with as well. Would mean rethinking Bond Pool and Downfall
- What if...we borrowed "When the Team First Came Together" from *MASKS* and/or the "Inciting Indicent" from *Avatar*? 
	- Use this as a way to give history to the characters from the get-go.
	- Could combine this with some kind 0of relationship questions too, maybe there is a gerneral pool/list of questions and each class gets a specifgic one.
- What if...take inspiration from *Fight, Item, Run* and use "Affinity Prompts" and maybe "Cutscenes" or things from different Classes.
- What if...we used "Background Questions" from *Kids on Bikes* as inspiration.
- Abilities
	- **Furious Roar** - Once per Session you can let out a great cry filled with the power of [[Anger]]. Roll Danger, can spend MP (maybe HP) to add dice. Add Successes to your action.
	- **Share Strength**
	- **Cold Hands, Warm Heart** 
		- [[Fire]] Ability
		- Spend MP to remove Condition
	- **From the Heart**
		- [[Synergist]] ability
		- comforting words to remove Condition, Bond Pool ability maybe, or this could be the making a gift with assist pool instead of **I Made This For You**.
- [[Linesmith]]
	- **Create Coincidence/Alter Fate** 
		- add dice to roll, after result seen. Upgrade free Reroll?
- [[Mechanist]]
	- Bond Pool - "Inventor", "Gadgets"
		- Use a gadget to boost an ally's roll without using your action, later increase to off turn to help pay cost to avoid attack/effect/hit
		- Make Gadget to give one of your Spell Pieces, this item has a pool to pull Successes from
		- Alter machine/weapon/construct, either decreasing difficulty to avoid attack or advance a particular goal
	- Robot Buddy
	- Bond Pool Ability - "Upgrade"
- [[Oathbound]]
	- make Bond Pool Ability that creates a Pact with something, pick a Spell Piece and skill this helps with, or maybe that's the actual Pool itself. And then the Ability would be to either access those bonuses or to add have that summoned being help.
	- maybe then the Downfall would be to lose that contract and have to create another to get it back or maybe Summon another.
- [[Synergist]]
	- mess with the bonds between people
	- understands people's emotions/motives
	- **Here, Use Mine** - give ally the ability to use your Facet or Skill instead of theirs to accomplish something, maybe allow them a reroll with yours.
		- change name **I Can Help**, **Here let me**, something along those lines.
	- **I Need to Borrow That** - use ally's Spell Piece, Facet, Ability once per Scene/Session.
- What if...most common = Elemental (1,2,3); uncommon = Emotional (4,5); rare = Primal (6)
- Each Elemental Realm offers at least 1 Background Question that fits thematically. (change to all Realms)
- What if...Death and Fate/Luck are added to [[Primal]] category, would replace [[Abomination]] or [[Nightmares]]. Do I still have Dreams? If [[Spirits]] is still a thing, replace that?
- What is...we use some kind of game mechanic to encourage Teamwork. Like checkboxes that get X when you help an ally or do some kind of bond forming or RP that is emotionally poignant/interesting and can spend to add Success to action for free. OR maybe it's a "Stat" that you roll to help with that many Dice, on Success you add to action, on Edge Success it costs 1 from the Pool, on Miss it costs 1 plus GM can make move or maybe get injury?
- What if...during Random Generation you would get different tables for Class based on Category
- What if...Magic/Special Items had a Tag, Skill, or Spell Piece attached to them, and a pool of Successes to pull from. This would treat items as if they were their own Bond Pool. This would fit well with Abilities from the Mechanist, Extractor, Synergist, maybe Linesmith or Wielder. Although I do like keeping them in distinct Classes to give them a sense of uniqueness or separateness or specialness.
- I want...the feel of this game to be epic and over-the-top. Shonen & Magical Girl feels. I want this to be giving Exalted vibes. Especially with some of the Portals/Realms/Magics/Rifts.
- I want...some of the Realms to include Light, Shadow, Life, Death, Storms, Plants/Wood/Life/Nature
- What if...Portal/Realm gives another Assist Pool to use the words or abilities within. The first time this Pool empties in a Session/Scene you take an Injury.
- What if...we changed stats to Zeal, Grit, Intuition, Bluster
	- Daring = Zeal
	- Understanding = Intuition
	- Adaptability = Grit
- What if...Unifier is why the Citadel was created. They tried to bring the Guilds together to bring peace & harmony to the world. but somewhere along the way they became Corrupted by the Aethyr or their mission. 
	- Was originally thinking that they were Synergist but maybe they were an Oathbound or Wielder and either their Oath or Implement became Corrupted and warped their mission
- What if...Unifier was the one who wanted to bring Aethyr to the masses and this is actually what caused the Cataclysm.
- What is...we brought back the idea of a Corruption track? This fits with the current ideas & timeline floating in my head. Maybe one of the Injuries/Wounds consequences.
- Everyone comes to The Citadel through their own Path/Journey. Along the way they discover their class? OR maybe they come to The Citadel to learn & train once they discover their Spark. Need to somehow work this into the new history. I've made where everyone gets access to Magic. Do we make it where certain people are born with a Spark or maybe everyone's Spark is dormant and some even then turns the Spark on. Maybe even some people are born with theirs already on but this is rare, just like those born with no Spark. Maybe if everyone is born with Spark then Skill/Power/Desire are what separates Guardians from everyone else?
- Need to replace HP with some kind of mechanical effects.
- What if...each Realm gave an Overcharge Ability that cost Corruption to use. Or maybe one use per Session and Corruption to use again.
- History
	- Aethyr used to be one unified force when the Wanderer first arrived. 
	- The Wanderer taught those who were able to learn, thereby creating the first Classes
	- The Equalizer through trying to bring Aethyr to everyone split it into different types of magic or rifts
	-
