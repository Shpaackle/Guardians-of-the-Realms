- Use something like "Affinities" from *Fight, Item, Run* or "Team Moves" from *MASKS*. Reveal a deep secret, confide in ally, workshop this.
	- [[Synergist]] needs to play on this hard
	- maybe this can add 1 Success to a roll or clear a Condition
- Change Level/Season to something like Rank/Tier
- Change/Split [[Linesmith]] to Forger/Artificer/Crafter, Aethyr Forge/Smith, Fate Spinner, Fate Weaver

- Conduit is kinda like Warlock/Cleric, you Channel the power of something bigger greater. This gives the GM something to work with as well. Would mean rethinking Bond Pool and Downfall
- What if...we borrowed "When the Team First Came Together" from *MASKS* and/or the "Inciting Indicent" from *Avatar*? 
	- Use this as a way to give history to the characters from the get-go.
	- Could combine this with some kind 0of relationship questions too, maybe there is a gerneral pool/list of questions and each class gets a specifgic one.
- What if...take inspiration from *Fight, Item, Run* and use "Affinity Prompts" and maybe "Cutscenes" or things from different Classes.
- What if...we used "Background Questions" from *Kids on Bikes* as inspiration.
