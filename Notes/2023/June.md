- Use something like "Affinities" from *Fight, Item, Run* or "Team Moves" from *MASKS*. Reveal a deep secret, confide in ally, workshop this.
	- [[Synergist]] needs to play on this hard
	- maybe this can add 1 Success to a roll or clear a Condition
- Change Level/Season to something like Rank/Tier
- Change/Split [[Linesmith]] to Forger/Artificer/Crafter, Aethyr Forge/Smith, Fate Spinner, Fate Weaver
- [[Conduit]] Ability - Once per Scene/Combat/Session a nearby ally can use one of your Spell Pieces instrad of the Local ones. You can still add one of yours to make it a Chord
- Conduit is kinda like Warlock/Cleric, you Channel the power of something bigger greater. This gives the GM something to work with as well. Would mean rethinking Bond Pool and Downfall
- What if...we borrowed "When the Team First Came Together" from *MASKS* and/or the "Inciting Indicent" from *Avatar*? 
	- Use this as a way to give history to the characters from the get-go.
	- Could combine this with some kind 0of relationship questions too, maybe there is a gerneral pool/list of questions and each class gets a specifgic one.
- What if...take inspiration from *Fight, Item, Run* and use "Affinity Prompts" and maybe "Cutscenes" or things from different Classes.
- What if...we used "Background Questions" from *Kids on Bikes* as inspiration.
- Abilities
	- **Furious Roar** - Once per Session you can let out a great cry filled with the power of [[Anger]]. Roll Danger, can spend MP (maybe HP) to add dice. Add Successes to your action.
	- **Share Strength**
	- **Cold Hands, Warm Heart** 
		- [[Fire]] Ability
		- Spend MP to remove Condition
	- **From the Heart**
		- [[Synergist]] ability
		- comforting words to remove Condition, Bond Pool ability maybe, or this could be the making a gift with assist pool instead of **I Made This For You**.
- [[Linesmith]]
	- **Create Coincidence/Alter Fate** 
		- add dice to roll, after result seen. Upgrade free Reroll?
- [[Mechanist]]
	- Bond Pool - "Inventor", "Gadgets"
		- Use a gadget to boost an ally's roll without using your action, later increase to off turn to help pay cost to avoid attack/effect/hit
		- Make Gadget to give one of your Spell Pieces, this item has a pool to pull Successes from
		- Alter machine/weapon/construct, either decreasing difficulty to avoid attack or advance a particular goal
	- Robot Buddy
	- Bond Pool Ability - "Upgrade"
- [[Oathbound]]
	- make Bond Pool Ability that creates a Pact with something, pick a Spell Piece and skill this helps with, or maybe that's the actual Pool itself. And then the Ability would be to either access those bonuses or to add have that summoned being help.
	- maybe then the Downfall would be to lose that contract and have to create another to get it back or maybe Summon another.
- [[Synergist]]
	- mess with the bonds between people
	- understands people's emotions/motives
	- **Here, Use Mine** - give ally the ability to use your Facet or Skill instead of theirs to accomplish something, maybe allow them a reroll with yours.
		- change name **I Can Help**, **Here let me**, something along those lines.
	- **I Need to Borrow That** - use ally's Spell Piece, Facet, Ability once per Scene/Session.
- What if...most common = Elemental (1,2,3); uncommon = Emotional (4,5); rare = Primal (6)
- Each Elemental Realm offers at least 1 Background Question that fits thematically. (change to all Realms)
- What if...Death and Fate/Luck are added to [[Primal]] category, would replace [[Abomination]] or [[Nightmares]]. Do I still have Dreams? If [[Spirits]] is still a thing, replace that?
- What is...we use some kind of game mechanic to encourage Teamwork. Like checkboxes that get X when you help an ally or do some kind of bond forming or RP that is emotionally poignant/interesting and can spend to add Success to action for free. OR maybe it's a "Stat" that you roll to help with that many Dice, on Success you add to action, on Edge Success it costs 1 from the Pool, on Miss it costs 1 plus GM can make move or maybe get injury?
- What if...during Random Generation you would get different tables for Class based on Category
- What if...Magic/Special Items had a Tag, Skill, or Spell Piece attached to them, and a pool of
