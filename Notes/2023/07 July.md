- [[Wielder]] - Imbue Implement with Spell Piece, add Successes to attack or extra Dice. Maybe this is a level up Ability or Assist Pool?

# 7-12
- *Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better* - ability for one of the Rifts. Maybe a Corruption ability for Synergist. If you repeat an action that requires a roll that another character did, you can add 1 or 2 dice.
- Ability - Can spend Strain to block an enemy from using an ability, or takes away 1 action for a turn.

# 7-20
- *Go Big or Go Home* - Conduit?? Ability to double Successes if treat all as Edge.
- Oathbound 
	- Go back to playing with words idea.
	- Make it so they literally use words to attack?
	- Maybe their Bond Pool turns into something like "Contract." Player describes how their Contract manifests. Use the words of the Contract, actual ink/letters/runes of how it manifests.
- Mechanist or Leysmith - look at Aethernaut from C07S (pg. 394) for inspiration.
	- Devices
	- Precision
- Look at "Occult Adventures" from Pathfinder for ideas
- Check out Kineticist as well, there is an Archetype in C07S that was mineable.
- Look at that MASKS add-on that takes inspiration from Anime.

# 7-22
- Anger Ability
	- Give aura or character alone that decreases the difficulty for Destroy.
	- Or maybe lets another number be a Success, maybe even changing Edge.
	- Once per Session/Day, effects the whole Encounter or maybe as many Rounds/Turns as Strain expended.
- Shape Element
	- Ability for some/all of the Elemental Realms, maybe even some Primal (ie Light, Shadow)

## [[Wielder]]
- ![[02 February#Wielder]]
- Tank/Striker split
- Ability named Bulwark/Stalwart that allows you to take all attacks fro a round without taking damage. 
	- Season 5 ability, maybe 4?

## Conduit
- ![[02 February#Conduit]]
- Striker or Controller/Support split
- **Form of Aethyr**
	- your body becomes made of magic and allows you to ignore an injury.
	- Maybe a Bond Pool ability

## Synergist
- ![[02 February#Synergist]]
- Support/Healer/Controller
## Realms
- Had another thought about making Realm just another Assist Pool
- Also had thoughts about choosing Spell Pieces
	- You get a certain number of pieces to choose, and an be chosen however you want to split between your Class and Realm
- What if I did bring all the Realms down to like 5 per category? Then I could add more as time goes on if I want to. This would help with some
