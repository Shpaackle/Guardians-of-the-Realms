## Random Thoughts
- Give [[Synergist]] ability to see connections with people 
- Everyone can intuitively use magic since it’s basically everywhere.  Only those with a dimensional connection can truly wield it to do great things. The game isn’t about being magical, that’s a given.  It’s about what you do with that magic and how it’s used to help the world around you.  You are what keep people safe from the dangers of a truly magical and untamed world.
