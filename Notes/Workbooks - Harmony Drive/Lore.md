# How does the magic work in your world?
## Original
Spiritual energy, Aethyr, suffuses the planet traveling along Ley Lines between the portals. New branches can be created to bring a more plentiful supply to a location, but these areas create points of weakness in the Line and need to be maintained/monitored.

# What relationship do you want players to have to magic?
## Original
Aethyr has become an industry all on its own. Not only is it in the atmosphere and ground, but society has incorporated it as an energy source. Not everyone is born with the Spark to become a Guardian, but many people are born with a latent ability to manipulate the energy around them. There is also a place for retired Guardians to go for research or government, etc. to put their powers to the betterment of society.

# How does your game lore express the value of Teamwork?
## Original
Aethyr is inherently easy to combine, especially when done through different means, i.e. Wielder + Conduit, since each of these distills the energy in a different way. Aethyr wants to be whole, wants to be more.
