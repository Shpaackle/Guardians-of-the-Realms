# What happens when Magic is all spent? How is it regained?
## Original
### Spent
Players lose connection with the world around them. They seem to fade, emotions are numbed. It's as if the essence of life itself had been drained from everywhere.
### Regained
Each MG has learned their own way to reconnect with the Aethyr but regardless of the means it takes time and attention. For some it's a good nights rest, for others it's hours spent in training or meditation. Whatever it may be, it cannot be done rushed or without intention.
