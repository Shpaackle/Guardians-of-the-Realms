*Counterattack* - make roll after being attacked? Or maybe 1/combat when an enemy misses with an attack or it's saved against. Probably belongs with the [[Guardians/Wielder]] maybe as a **Bond Pool** ability??

*Intercept* - Get in way of attack so that it is aimed at you instead.

*Make a Plan* - With time to prepare before encounter, you get free first round maybe extra dice to the **Advantage Pool**.
